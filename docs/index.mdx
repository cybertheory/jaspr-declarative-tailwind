# Quickstart

The Tailwind Class generator can be used in a Jaspr app or in any other dart project where inline Tailwind utility classes are needed.
It allows you to generate the needed Tailwind classes in a Flutter like structure.

If you are using the declarative Tailwind generator for Jaspr, make sure you have jaspr installed and (setup)[https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr/quick-start].

Then create a new jaspr project.
```bash
jaspr create my_new_project
```

Install JDT
'''bash
dart pub add jaspr-declarative-Tailwind
'''

If you are not using Jaspr, just install JDT and use it as needed.
